### Using with AI Tools

To incorporate these sketch-style elements in AI prototyping tools:

3. Or direct prompt: "Create a hand-drawn version of my interface using these sketch styles"

### Integrating in Your Project

#### Method 1: Copy CSS and Components

1. Copy the `marker-styles.css` file into your project
2. Import the CSS file in your main entry point
3. Copy the React components from the `src/components/marker` directory
4. Use the components in your application

```jsx
import './path/to/marker-styles.css';
import { SketchButton, SketchCard } from './path/to/components';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <SketchCard title="Welcome!">
        <p>This is my sketch-style card</p>
        <SketchButton>Click Me!</SketchButton>
      </SketchCard>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Method 2: Tailwind Integration

Add these classes to your Tailwind config:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily: {
        'comic': ['"Comic Sans MS"', 'cursive']
      },
      // other extensions from marker-tailwind-config.js
    }
  }
}
```
